          <h2>Where it all started</h2>
          <p>
            As a competitive dancer for nearly 13 years, Maya had to learn the best methods and techniques of applying makeup that not only photographed well but also looked as natural as possible under harsh lighting. Through learning about stage makeup Maya quickly began to experiment and find a deeper love for the the art of makeup. Practicing on family, friends and anyone who was willing, Maya enjoyed helping others achieve not only the look they desired but feel their most beautiful. After a couple years she finally decided to embark on her own journey as a makeup artist.
